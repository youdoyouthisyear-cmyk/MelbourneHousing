Melbourne Housing Availability Diagnostics: LGA Supply Trends, Adequacy, and Delivery Bottlenecks (2020-2026)

# Objectives
1. Map historical changes (2020-2025) in population, vacancies, and approvals across Melbourne LGAs by CBD proximity to reveal spatial supply-demand patterns.

2. Assess current completions against population growth to identify adequately supplied LGAs and project 2026 shortages.

3. Quantify approval-to-completion lags by neighborhood to pinpoint execution bottlenecks delaying stock delivery.

4. Deliver actionable insights for government stakeholders to accelerate housing supply through targeted interventions.

# Target Audience
City of Melbourne: Inner suburb renewal planning, spatial trend analysis.

Victorian Department of Planning & Housing: Statewide supply forecasting, policy target validation (44k/year).

Local Councils (31 Melbourne LGAs): Zoning prioritization, infrastructure alignment in growth/decline areas.

Secondary: DELWP planners, REIV analysts seeking data-driven supply diagnostics.

# Research Questions
Q1. Which Melbourne LGAs have seen the biggest changes in population, rental vacancies, and new home approvals over the past five years, and how are these trends related to their distance from the CBD?
(EDA: Trends by spatial gradients)

Q2. Which Melbourne LGAs have enough new homes being built to meet local demand, and where are shortages expected by 2026?
(Predictive: Supply-demand ratios + forecasts)

Q3. How long does it take for approved buildings to be completed in different Melbourne neighborhoods, and where are the longest delays?
(Diagnostic: Process efficiency metrics)
